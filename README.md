## 🌐 Node.js CRUD API (Without Express)

A lightweight RESTful API built **entirely with Node.js core modules** — no external frameworks like Express.  
This project demonstrates how to handle **HTTP requests**, **file storage**, and **events** in a clean, modular way.

### 🚀 Features

- 📦 **Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD)** operations using HTTP methods  
- 💾 **Persistent storage** using a local `data.json` file  
- ⚙️ **Custom event emitter** for logging actions  
- 🔥 **No frameworks used** — pure Node.js (`http`, `fs`, `events`)  
- 🧠 **Auto-generated IDs** for stored items
